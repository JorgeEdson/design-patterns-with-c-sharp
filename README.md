# Design Patterns With C#
In this repository I'm demonstrating the main design patterns using the c# language

# Creation Patterns

- **Factory Method:** The purpose of this pattern is to create a "factory" of classes that dynamically decides at runtime which class will be instantiated
- **Abstract Factory:** With this pattern we are able to use a flexible algorithm capable of creating ("manufacturing") according to specific compositions Different Types of Entities
- **Singleton:** The purpose of this pattern is to ensure that only one instance of a class is used.
- **Builder:** The intent of this pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

# Structure Patterns
- **Adapter:** This pattern makes it possible to adapt the use of the same methods of different classes.
- **Flyweight:** This pattern aims to improve performance by sharing similar characteristics without the need to instantiate new objects..
