# Design Patterns With C#
In this repository I'm demonstrating the main design patterns using the c# language

# Creation Patterns
- **Factory Method:** The purpose of this pattern is to create a "factory" of classes that dynamically decides at runtime which class will be instantiated. Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete class.
- **Abstract Factory:** With this pattern we are able to use a flexible algorithm capable of creating ("manufacturing") according to specific compositions Different Types of Entities
- **Singleton:** The purpose of this pattern is to ensure that only one instance of a class is used.
- **Builder:** The intent of this pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

# Structure Patterns
- **Adapter:** This pattern makes it possible to adapt the use of the same methods of different classes.
- **Flyweight:** This pattern improves performance by sharing similar characteristics without the need to instantiate new objects.
- **Bridge:** This pattern allows the development of objects that compose this hierarchy independently of each other. Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so the two can vary independently
- **Composite:** Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Allows customers to treat individual objects and object compositions uniformly
- **Decorator:** Attach additional responsabilities to an object dynamically. Provide a flexible alternative to sub class for extending functionality
